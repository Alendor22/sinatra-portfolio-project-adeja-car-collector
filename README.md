# Sinatra-Portfolio-Project-Adeja-Car-Collector

- Overview

The intended use of the car collector app is to create cars, view a list of cars and there details/attributes.  A user can sign up as a new user then begin to create a new car, once a car is created it will become part of the users collection and will be able to be viewed as such, if a user creates another car it will be listed as one of the users cars and added to their collection as well.  A user can view other users' cars in their collection as well by clicking that cars link, but he\she will not be given access to edit\delete the cars of other users.  A user can only edit\delete cars he\she has created by clicking the link of the car created by that specific user, the edit\delete option will become visible on the page when the car is displayed.  A user may also edit\delete their profile as well.  Once a user deletes their profile they will be brought back to the base URL\URI and given an opportunity to create a new user by signing up again.
